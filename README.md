Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a Google-provided set of cloud computing services. It is a platform that offers computing infrastructure and services for running applications, storing and managing data, and developing software solutions.

### Key Technologies Used:  
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Comprehensive suite of cloud services by Google.  
- **Cloud SQL**: Database management for our application.  
- **Cloud Storage**: Secure and scalable storage solution for application assets.  
- **Cloud Run**: Seamlessly deploys our machine learning models.  
- **Memorystore Redis**: Provides robust caching and session management.  
- **Load Balancer**: Ensures high availability by distributing traffic across services.  
- **Pub/Sub**: Enables event-driven communication and asynchronous messaging.
